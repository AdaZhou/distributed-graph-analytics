===========================

Distributed Graph Analytics (DGA) is a compendium of graph analytics written for Bulk-Synchronous-Parallel (BSP) processing frameworks such as Giraph and GraphX.

Currently, DGA supports the following analytics:

###### Giraph
- Weakly Connected Components
- Leaf Compression
- Page Rank
- High Betweenness Set Extraction
- Louvain

###### GraphX
- Louvain Modularity (initial stage)

Eventually, the following analytics will be supported:

- Weakly Connected Components
- High Betweenness Set Extraction
- Leaf Compression
- Page Rank
