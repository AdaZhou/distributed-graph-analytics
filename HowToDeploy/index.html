    Deploy DGA-Giraph</h3>
<pre>
    <code>
        $ git clone git@github.com:Sotera/distributed-graph-analytics.git
        $ cd distributed-graph-analytics
        $ gradle clean distDGA
        $ cp -r dga-giraph/build/dist /path/of/your/choosing
    </code>
</pre>
<p><b>Note:</b> You must make sure you add your respective zookeeper nodes to the list via the command below.  The property is giraph.zkList.  It takes a comma seperated list with no spaces!</p>
<pre>
<code>
    $ vi dga-giraph/src/main/resources/dga-config.xml
</code>

<h3><a name="configuring-dga-giraph" class="anchor"
       href="#configuring-dga-giraph"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span></a> Configuring DGA-Giraph</h3>
<p>DGA Giraph has 3 means of configuration; defaults, configuration file values, and command line configuration settings. Any configuration
    key specified in the default will be overridden by that same key if it is given in the configuration file. Any configuration key
    specified in either the default or the configuration file will be overridden by the property if specified on the command line.</p>
<p>
    Configuration file changes are meant to apply to dga-giraph for the general use of the install. Things like a reasonable memory setting
    for mapred.map.child.javaa.opts or number of workers or giraph.zkList are excellent values to place in the configuration file. Then, if
    you need more memory or more workers, you can override the configuration file by passing in the same arguments via the command line.
</p>
<p>The options we allow you to specify are broken into 2 main types; -D key=value and -ca key=value. In the XML configuration file, we have
    3 types total; one of which are the base flags built into Giraph (things like -w or -q) (which we call system (-D parameters), custom
    (-ca parameters), and default - do not confuse this default with the default configuration values hard coded into the class
    com.soteradefense.dga.DGARunner)</p>
<p>A full list of the options that you can provide to each analytic can be found on this page: <a
        href="/distributed-graph-analytics/Configurations/">DGA Giraph Options</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Unfortunately, the -D key=value pair is slightly different than Giraph's, which requires it in the form of -Dkey=value
        (no space). Please note it operates exactly like Giraph's and is how you can pass <a href="http://giraph.apache.org/options.html">Giraph
        Options</a> through to the
        system.

        There is a current bug where the dga-config.xml located in distributed-graph-analytics/dga-giraph/main/resources is included in the
        uber jar that distDGA builds; this is a legacy issue from our attempt at adding this resource to YARN - which we don't even fully
        support yet. To make configuration changes for your cluster, please make them in this file and rebuild the uber jar. You can still
        override every setting in the configuration file via the command line.
