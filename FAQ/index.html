<p>Take a look at your data. Make sure there are no \t's anywhere or any other characters that might cause the input to fail.</p>

<h4><a name="how-data" class="anchor" href="#how-data"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span></a> How do I format my data, so it will work with DGA?</h4>
<p>Using your own data with DGA is simple! Make sure the file is an edge list of the following format.</p>
<p>Source,Target,EdgeValue</p>
<p>It must be a character separated file, so you can use commas, TABS, etc. If you use anything other than the default, then you must let us know via a configuration value.</p>
