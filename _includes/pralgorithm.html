    <li>
        Calculate your rank based on the initial value divided by the number of edges you have.
    </li>
    <li>
        Send your rank to all your edges.
    </li>
    <li>
        Accumulate all incoming messages and calculate your new rank.

        Stop whenever the max change is less than an epsilon value of 0.001.
