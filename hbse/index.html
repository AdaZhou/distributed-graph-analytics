<h3><a name="implementation" class="anchor" href="#implementation"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span></a> Implementation</h3>
<p>Our implementation is distributed using the BSP method on Apache giraph and built with Gradle. Giraph requires a Hadoop cluster (map
    reduce and hdfs)</p>

<h3><a name="io" class="anchor" href="#io"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span></a> I/O</h3>

<p>The graph is read from an edge list file in HDFS, each line in the file represents a single edge and is coded as a "key,target,weight"
    (edge weight is optional and defaults to 1)</p>
<p>Output is a directory in HDFS with both the extracted high betweenness set and the approximate betweenness value for all nodes.</p>
