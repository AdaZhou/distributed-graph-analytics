    <li>
        Initialize the same value to each vertex.
    </li>
    <li>
        Calculate your rank based on the initial value divided by the number of edges you have.
    </li>
    <li>
        Send your rank to all your edges.
    </li>
    <li>
        Accumulate all incoming messages and calculate your new rank.
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeat step 2.

    <li>
        Stop whenever the max change is less than an epsilon value of 0.001.

<p>The picture above shows the PageRank of that specific graph. As you can see, the more times a node references another, the higher the PageRank.  The nodes that are referenced the least,
    have the least PageRank.</p>
